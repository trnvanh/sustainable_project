## Issue: Cannot Remove Products from Cart

### ✅ Solution Successfully Implemented and Tested

The cart removal functionality has been fully implemented and tested. Here's what was accomplished:

- ✅ `removeFromCart` function works correctly
- ✅ Uses `filter` to remove items by ID
- ✅ Properly clears errors when removing items
- ✅ Persists changes to AsyncStorage

### 2. **Improved Cart Screen** (`/app/cart/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Added confirmation dialog for item removal
- ✅ Added success messages when items are removed
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and display
- ✅ Integrated with new order system

### 3. **New Order Management System**
- ✅ Created `/api/orders.ts` for backend API integration
- ✅ Created `/store/useOrderStore.ts` for order state management
- ✅ Added order creation, payment, and cancellation functionality
- ✅ Integrated cart checkout with order creation

### 4. **Enhanced Order Display**
- ✅ Created `/components/EnhancedOrderCard.tsx`
- ✅ Updated `/app/orders/index.tsx` with proper order management
- ✅ Added refresh functionality and loading states

## API Endpoints Integrated

The following APIs mentioned in your request are now properly integrated:

```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders            ✅ createOrderApi()
POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders/{{orderId}}/pay    ✅ payOrderApi()
GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders            ✅ getOrdersApi()
POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders/{{orderId}}/cancel ✅ cancelOrderApi()
GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders/{{orderId}}        ✅ getOrderByIdApi()
PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders/{{orderId}}/status  ✅ updateOrderStatusApi()
```

## How Cart Removal Now Works

2. Item is automatically removed from cart

### Method 3: Clear All Items
1. Tap the trash icon in the header
2. Confirm clearing all items
3. All items are removed with success message
