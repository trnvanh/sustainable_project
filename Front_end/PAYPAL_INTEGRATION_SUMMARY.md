- **Functionality**: "Pay Now" button for orders with pending payment status
- **Features**:
  - Visual payment status indicators
  - User feedback during payment process
  - Error handling for failed payment attempts

### 4. App State Management
- **Location**: `hooks/useAppStateHandler.ts`
- **Functionality**: Monitors app state changes to refresh orders when returning from PayPal
- **Implementation**: Automatically refreshes order list when app becomes active

### 5. User Experience Improvements
- **Location**: `app/cart/index.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Clear messaging about PayPal redirection
  - Delayed navigation to allow payment process
  - Success/error feedback with appropriate timing

### 6. Payment Status Tracking
- **Locations**: Multiple components
- **Features**:
  - Visual payment status badges
  - Separation of payment and order status

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration
```typescript
// Automatic payment after order creation
const paymentResponse = await payOrderApi(response.data.id);
if (paymentResponse.success && paymentResponse.data?.redirectUrl) {
    await Linking.openURL(paymentResponse.data.redirectUrl);
}
```

### Payment Status Management
```typescript
// Enhanced order interface with payment status
interface Order {
    id: string;
    status: 'pending' | 'preparing' | 'ready' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
    paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'failed';
    // ... other fields
}
```

### App State Monitoring
```typescript
// Refresh orders when returning from PayPal
AppState.addEventListener('change', (nextAppState) => {
    if (appState.current.match(/inactive|background/) && nextAppState === 'active') {
        fetchOrders();
    }
});
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Seamless User Experience**: Automatic payment initiation reduces friction
2. **Fallback Options**: Manual payment button for failed automatic attempts
3. **Real-time Updates**: App state monitoring ensures payment status accuracy
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Visual Feedback**: Clear payment status indicators and progress messages
